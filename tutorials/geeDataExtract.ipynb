    "This package includes functions to download environmental and remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine, using the GEE python API. Environmental data can be extracted at the nearest pixel to a point or spatially averaged over pixels around a buffer from a point or within a polygon. Shapefiles of points or polygons must be [uploaded to GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/importing) in your [assets folder](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). Data tables will be automatically downloaded to your Google Drive. Functions exist for downloading environmental data related to land cover, topography, soil condition, climate, soil moisture (SMOS), and Landsat & MODIS vegetation indices/products. A complete tutorial in jupyter notebooks can be found [here](https://www.pbgjam.org/products#Tutorials/). This package was developed under the support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Advanced Information Systems Technology Program [(award number AIST-16-0052)](https://esto.nasa.gov/files/solicitations/AIST_16/ROSES2016_AIST_A41_awards.html#swenson) and the National Science Foundation [(award number 1754443)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1754443&HistoricalAwards=false). This package is still preliminary; we are constantly making updates and improvements. Please email me with any comments or suggestions at aschwantes@gmail.com. \n",

    "### Download the GEE API\n",
    "To use these functions you must [install the GEE python API](https://github.com/earthlab/tutorials/blob/master/documentation/intro-google-earth-engine-python-api.md). We recommend first installing [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and registering for a [Google Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/). Then run the following commands from the Command Prompt (windows), the Terminal (mac), or the \"Anaconda Prompt\". Examples below are for Anaconda, but you can also use pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the python API client\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge google-api-python-client\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Install the Earth Engine Python Library\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api\n",
    "```\n",
    "3.  Initialize the API and verify your account settings. This will open a web-browser. Login to your Gmail account and copy/paste the key from the web-browser into the Command Prompt. You will need to login to the Gmail account that you\n",
    "used to sign up for Google Earth Engine.\n",
    "```\n",
    "earthengine authenticate\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Verify that the GEE API is working. You should not get an error by running this command.\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -c \"import ee; ee.Initialize()\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Install geedataextact\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install geedataextract\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Important next steps\n",
    "* **Add a new folder to your google drive.** You will need to specify this folder name using the parameter folderOut in each function. CSV files will be downloaded in this folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How to use your own data?** To extract values at your points/polygons of interest, you will need to upload a shapefile to your assets folder in GEE; instructions __[here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/importing)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + Add an ID column to your shapefile with the name \"geeID\" before you upload your file to your assets folder.  \n",
    "  + Each row must have a unique ID.  \n",
    "  + Each row/geeID should be unique through space. Do not include duplicate points through time; time-series data will be downloaded for each unique geeID.\n",
    "  + To reduce the file size of the output tables, location information is removed. The geeID field is required to restore location information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Set your username**. Each function has a parameter called \"username\", which must be specified. Your GEE username is typically your Gmail address. Look in the asset folder under users to verify [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **To obtain data at points or spatial averages within polygons use the parameters buf and poly.** If you want the nearest pixel to an uploaded shapefile of points, then set buf = 0 and poly = 0. If you want a spatial average from a buffer around each point, then specify a value for buf in meters. For example, poly = 0 and buf = 1000, would give a spatial average of the pixels within a 1000 m radius circle around each point in your uploaded shapefile. If you want a spatial average within polygons for an uploaded shapefile of polygons, then set buf = 0 and poly = 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Consider using the 'scalePix' parameter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  + If you need to take a spatial average across a plot, then you will need to consider the scale of the imagery. If the size of your plot/polygon is much smaller than the spatial resolution of your imagery (scale) then reduce the scale, by using the optional parameter 'scalePix'. Or provide centroids for your plots instead of taking a spatial average. GEE functions take the weighted average within a polygon; however any pixels that are not 50% within the polygon are not included in the averaging. If your scale is much larger than your plot, all your output tables will be full of NAs.\n",
    "  + Similarly, to take a value at a point, for environmental data at fine-scales, we'd recommend reducing the 'scalePix'. If the scalepix is set to the resolution of the environmental data (the default in our functions), GEE functions will often give a value of a point that is shifted by up to the value of scalePix. Therefore, if you want to avoid a point shift, then reduce 'scalePix' to a value less than the spatial resolution of the dataset (the default in our functions).\n",

    "### Below we provide descriptions for downloading data as well as suggested citations\n",
    "\n",
    "When using this python package, we have tried to include suggested citations for each of the data products. GEE is simply hosting publically available data; therefore if you use one of these functions to download a dataset you should properly give credit to the authors who created the dataset. We have provided suggested citations; however, please refer to the original websites/links to metadata for each dataset to confirm that these suggested citations are current. \n",
