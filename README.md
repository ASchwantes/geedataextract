# **geedataextract**

This package includes functions to download environmental and remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine, using the GEE python API. Environmental data can be extracted at the nearest pixel to a point or spatially averaged over pixels around a buffer from a point or within a polygon. Shapefiles of points or polygons must be [uploaded to GEE](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/importing) in your [assets folder](https://code.earthengine.google.com/). Data tables will be automatically downloaded to your Google Drive. Functions exist for downloading environmental data related to land cover, topograpy, soil condition, climate, soil moisture (SMOS), and landsat & MODIS vegetation indices/products. A complete tutorial in jupyter notebooks can be found [here](https://www.pbgjam.org/products#Tutorials/). This package was developed under the support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Advanced Information Systems Technology Program [(award number AIST-16-0052)](https://esto.nasa.gov/files/solicitations/AIST_16/ROSES2016_AIST_A41_awards.html#swenson) and the National Science Foundation [(award number 1754443)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1754443&HistoricalAwards=false). This package is still preliminary; we are constantly making updates and improvements. Please email me with any comments or suggestions at aschwantes@gmail.com.

### Download the GEE API
To use these functions you must [install the GEE python API](https://github.com/earthlab/tutorials/blob/master/documentation/intro-google-earth-engine-python-api.md). We recommend first installing [Anaconda Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and registering for a [Google Earth Engine account](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/). Then run the following commands from the Command Prompt (windows), the Terminal (mac), or the "Anaconda Prompt". Examples below are for Anaconda, but you can also use pip.

1. Install the python API client
```
conda install -c conda-forge google-api-python-client
```
2. Install the Earth Engine Python Library
```
conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api
```
3.  Initialize the API and verify your account settings. This will open a web-browser. Login to your gmail account and copy/paste the key from the web-browser into the Command Promt. You will need to login to the gmail account that you
used to sign up for Google Earth Engine.
```
earthengine authenticate
```
4. Verify that the GEE API is working. You should not get an error by running this command.
```
python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize()"
```

### Important next steps
* **Add a new folder to your google drive.** You will need to specify this folder name using the parameter folderOut in each function. CSV files will be downloaded in this folder.  


* **How to use your own data?** To extract values at your points/polygons of interest, you will need to upload a shapefile to your assets folder in GEE; instructions __[here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/importing)__.

  + Add an ID column to your shapefile with the name "geeID" before you upload your file to your assets folder.  
  + Each row must have a unique ID.  
  + Each row/geeID should be unique through space. Do not include duplicate points through time; time-series data will be downloaded for each unique geeID.
  + To reduce the file size of the output tables, location information is removed. The geeID field is required to restore location information.


* **Set your username**. Each function has a parameter called "username", which must be specified. Your GEE username is typically your gmail adress. Look in the asset folder under users to verify [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).


* **To obtain data at points or spatial averages within polygons use the parameters buf and poly.** If you want the nearest pixel to an uploaded shapefile of points, then set buf = 0 and poly = 0. If you want a spatial average from a buffer around each point, then specify a value for buf in meters. For example, poly = 0 and buf = 1000, would give a spatial average of the pixels within a 1000 m radius circle around each point in your uploaded shapefile. If you want a spatial average within polygons for an uploaded shapefile of polygons, then set buf = 0 and poly = 1.


* **Consider using the 'scalePix' parameter**.

  + If you need to take a spatial average across a plot, then you will need to consider the scale of the imagery. If the size of your plot/polygon is much smaller than the spatial resolution of your imagery (scale) then reduce the scale, by using the optional parameter 'scalePix'. Or provide centroids for your plots instead of taking a spatial average. GEE functions take the weighted average within a polygon; however any pixels that are not 50% within the polygon are not included in the averaging. If your scale is much larger than your plot, all your output tables will be full of NAs.
  + Similiarly, to take a value at a point, for environmental data at fine-scales, we'd recommend reducing the 'scalePix'. If the scalepix is set to the resolution of the environmental data (the default in our functions), GEE functions will often give a value of a point that is shifted by up to the value of scalePix. Therefore, if you want to avoid a point shift, then reduce 'scalePix' to a value less than the spatial resolution of the dataset (the default in our functions).

### Below we provide descriptions for downloading data as well as suggested citations

When using this python package, we have tried to include suggested citations for each of the data products. GEE is simply hosting publically available data; therefore if you use one of these functions to download a dataset you should properly give credit to the authors who created the dataset. We have provided suggested citations; however, please refer to the original websites/links to metadata for each dataset to confirm that these suggested citations are current.

Furthermore, when using GEE, see this [link](https://earthengine.google.com/faq/) for a suggested citation. Currently, GEE suggests the following:

## Topography

Source data is from the SRTM Digital Elevation Data 30m product. More info found __[here](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)__. The GEE ImageCollection ID is 'USGS/SRTMGL1_003'.


The function __GEEtopoPts()__ calculates topograpy metrics:
> elevation (meters)  
> slope (radians)  
> aspect (radians)  

When calculating aspect at a point, the output will include only one value of aspect (in radians). When taking a spatial average of aspect within a plot or buffer, two metrics are computed: (1) aspect_sin: aspectSinSum and (2) aspect_cos: aspectCosSum. The circular average of aspect can then be calculated using: atan2(aspectSinSum, aspectCosSum), as described __[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities)__.

# Remote Sensing Data

All the functions below can be used to download remote sensing data. Unless otherwise specified, each function has a parameter called timeStep, where you can specify the type of temporal averaging. Options include:  

    'lowest' for no temporal averaging
    'month' for monthly time-step
    'year' for annual time-steps

Caution, if you select 'lowest' for no temporal averaging then it may take a very long time to calculate your time-series.

Also, if you take monthly or annual averages, we are not interpolating before averaging. Therefore, in cloudy areas, this may not be good practise. Instead, use the lowest or monthly time-step for averaging and either exclude data points when there is too much missing data, and/or take averages after interpolating the missing data.

## Soil Moisture from SMOS

Source data from: NASA-USDA Global Soil Moisture Data. The GEE ImageCollection ID is "NASA_USDA/HSL/soil_moisture".

## Landsat Vegetation Indices

Source data from: USGS Landsat 4,5,7,& 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1 products. The GEE ImageCollection ID is 'LANDSAT/LT04/C01/T1_SR' (Landsat 4), 'LANDSAT/LT05/C01/T1_SR' (Landsat 5), 'LANDSAT/LE07/C01/T1_SR' (Landsat 7), and 'LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR' (Landsat 8).  Please see landsat surface reflectance product guides for [Landsat 4-7](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-4-7-surface-reflectance-code-ledaps-product-guide) and [Landsat 8](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-8-surface-reflectance-code-lasrc-product-guide).

The __GEEviLandsat()__ function calculates the temporal average as well as a spatial average either at a single point, within a buffer from a point or within a polygon.

#### The following vegetation indices can be selected:

> 'NDVI' = Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)  
> 'NDWI'; = Normalized Difference Water Index (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR)  
> 'NBR'; = Normalized Difference Burn Ratio (NIR-SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR)

This function relies on data from the surface reflectance product (atmospheric correction has already been applied). Pixels that have clouds or cloud shadows are removed before temporal averaging, using the QC layer specific to each pixel within an image in the time series.

The following Landsat satellites can be selected. Remember, each sensor has a unique time-period:  

> L4: Landsat 4 images taken from Aug 22, 1982 to Dec 14, 1993    
> L5: Landsat 5 images taken from Jan 1, 1984 to May 5, 2012    
> L7: Landsat 7 images taken from Jan 1, 1999 to present  
> L8: Landsat 8 images taken from Apr 11, 2013 to present

# NEX-GDDP: NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections

Global downscaled climate scenarios for 21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from CMIP5. Emission scenarios include options for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 from 2006-2099, as well as historical retrospective model runs from 1950-2006. More info can be found __[here](https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/projects/1356/)__. The GEE ImageCollection ID is "NASA/NEX-GDDP".

The function __GEEnasaNEXGDDP()__ provides future climate projections for precipitation and temperature (~25-km spatial resolution) as well as a spatial average either at a single point, within a buffer from a point or within a polygon.

The following metrics can be selected:

> 'pr' = sum of precipitation, liquid and solid phases (kg/(m^2*s))  
> 'tasmin' = mean daily min near surface air temperature (K)  
> 'tasmax' = mean daily max near surface air temperature (K)  

The following scenarios can be selected:

> 'historical'  
> 'rcp45'  
> 'rcp85'  

The following models can be selected:

> 'ACCESS1-0'  
> 'bcc-csm1-1'  
> 'BNU-ESM'  
> 'CanESM2'  
> 'CCSM4'  
> 'CESM1-BGC'  
> 'CNRM-CM5'  
> 'CSIRO-Mk3-6-0'  
> 'GFDL-CM3'  
> 'GFDL-ESM2G'  
> 'GFDL-ESM2M'  
> 'inmcm4'  
> 'IPSL-CM5A-LR'  
> 'IPSL-CM5A-MR'  
> 'MIROC-ESM'  
> 'MIROC-ESM-CHEM'  
> 'MIROC5'  
> 'MPI-ESM-LR'  
> 'MPI-ESM-MR'  
> 'MRI-CGCM3'  
> 'NorESM1-M'  

Best practice when averaging across months is to only output 10 years at a time. Otherwise you will get a "Computation timed out" error message on GEE, because you're requesting to process too much data at one time.
